## How Your Expedition Unfolds

1. Chart your course by entering a story prompt and selecting an expedition type (genre)
2. The app dispatches your expedition details to OpenAI's GPT API to craft your adventure narrative
3. A visual scout (DALL-E) creates an illustration capturing a key moment from your journey
4. Your complete expedition unfolds in an immersive, explorer-themed interface designed for discovery
5. The expedition narrator (Play.ht API) brings your adventure to life with high-quality AI narration
